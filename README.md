## Shell Assistant

This is a shell assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to interact with the user. It can use various tools and can continue a conversation based on previous outputs. It also handles user inputs and can exit when the user types 'exit'.

To use a tool, respond with the tool name and the required parameters. You can also use the `<continue>` tag to keep the conversation going based on previous outputs.

The assistant is proactive at using tools and assumes it is somewhere in a repository with files. It also confirms its changes worked by reading the file after editing it.
