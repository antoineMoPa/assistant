## Shell Assistant

This is a shell assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to interact with the user. It can use various tools and can continue a conversation based on previous outputs. It also handles user inputs and can exit when the user types 'exit'.

The assistant is proactive at using tools and assumes it is somewhere in a repository with files. It also confirms its changes worked by reading the file after editing it.
